# ARCAI
ARCAI is a conversational AI wallet agent that helps users manage, move, and optimize USDC on the Arc network. It parses plain-English requests with an LLM, runs deterministic safety checks, and constructs unsigned transactions for the user to sign â€” demo-ready for the Arc AI Agents + USDC hackathon.
